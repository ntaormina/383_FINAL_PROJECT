Final Project- A Digital Oscilloscope
=====================================
The aim of this project was to make a digital oscilloscope that
took in an analog voltage and plotted it on a VGA monitor. I worked with 
Kevan Mordan and John Miller on this project. Our first Project was an attempt at 
an artificial intelligence super mario brothers game written completely in VHDL.
When this proved improbable we switched to a more manageable project. 

What I did
==========
My responsibility for this project was writing most of the VHDL code to make the oscilloscope 
and additional functions work. I successfully made an oscilloscope in VHDL and designed several other 
screens such as a logic analyzer, logic probe, and voltage gauge. I also implemented a way to test and debug using 
the switched as an 8 bit input. 

My levels of functionality
==========================
Required-Display data received from the GPIO pins
B-Make a real time oscilloscope and other functions with this data from the ADC
A-Make Axes and labels for the o-scope

I achieved B functionality for my portion of the lab. We also obtained B functionality as a group.

Test/Debug
==========
To debug this lab I used the switches as an 8 bit signal simulating the ADC. I made small adjustments in the code to make 
everything display on the screen appropriately. To debug the ADC a few times I used a voltage meter and checked the output bits.

Conclusion
==========
I learned a ton about the capabilities and power of the FPGA and VHDL in general. I'm confident in my ability to solve
a problem from scratch like I did with the o-scope. I learned a ton about how oscilloscopes work as well. Next time more functions would have 
been added and maybe RAM for the o-scope.
